# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?
the r squared value is 0.626 it says that there is not much correlation between the blood pressure change over the change in age.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?
The predicted blood pressure is 137
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
I don't think the models predictions are very accurate as the r^2 value is only 0.626. I don't think this model is accurate enough to predict someones blood pressure based on their age. Because the model hasn't been trained on enough data, making the model is too generalized. As well as the fact that age isnt the only factor affecting blood pressure. More data and variables could improve the model.
