# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
0.86
2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
Yes its pretty accurate it has a average percent error of 12.45%
3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?
it predicts a 10yr old car with 89k miles to cost $9034. A 20 year old car with 150k miles is expected to cost $2152
4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?
Because it is a linear model, and not a curve so there must be a point where the car is $0 and anything after that is negative.
