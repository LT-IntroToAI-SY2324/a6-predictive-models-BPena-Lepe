# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
We can compare the models predictions to real data in this one.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
The r squared value is 0.52 means that the data isnt very correlated so the model can't be very accurate.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
I'd say its accurate because it had an average percent error of 8.7 which is pretty good.
